# Research

## Structural Proteomics

Our lab advances mass spectrometry–based structural proteomics with emphasis on footprinting, crosslinking, and hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX). These approaches enable us to map protein interfaces, solvent accessibility, and structural dynamics.

## Membrane Protein Biology

We focus on membrane proteins, which present unique structural challenges. Our work develops innovative footprinting strategies in membrane mimics and native-like environments to better understand disease-related mechanisms.

## Fast Photochemical Oxidation of Proteins (FPOP)

FPOP generates hydroxyl radicals using a pulsed 248 nm laser to selectively oxidize solvent-exposed residues. This technique allows mapping of protein-protein interactions and supports therapeutic development and epitope mapping.

## Applications in Drug Discovery

Our methods are increasingly applied to characterize protein therapeutics and map interaction sites in complex biological systems.
